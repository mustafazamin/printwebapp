# printwebapp
Starprint v2
This a Django project I'm currently working on for a 3d printing startup BAARILABS.
The project currently can be deployed only when the raspberry pi containing a octopi raspbian os is connected on same network.
The project is based on the octopi api and the octorest module.
Currently looking at new GUIs but the back end is complete.
Kinks in a few JavaScript function still under works.
